        intro: "In other words, these core principles should guide designers toward designing websites that have clear and effective UI, Good UX through navigation and other interactions, and finally the aesthetics of the site should be designed with the siteâ€™s sender, type, genre, and target audience in mind.",

        intro: "Design should follow the principles from the Design Justice Network in order to overcome design issues resulting in oppression, exploitation or unhappiness. I also agree with Spyros with regards to the importance of looking at the impact internet access has on society so that we can make a decision that could improve the quality of life of many people around the world.",

        intro: " Throughout this block I believe that I have progressed practically. I have learned how to work with react as well as node. React was a very new experience, and it took me a while to get used to. ",

        title: "Preparatory Work",
        intro: "  My website is my artwork. My plan is to use the CSS to manipulate the layout, colours, and the background to evoke a feeling of loneliness and desperation for connection.  ",

        title: "Self Reflection 2",
        intro: "Going forward I believe I can improve both the site and the net-art side of it by adding more interactive elements. How I would do this I'm not too sure yet, but for the time being I'm pleased with how my website turned out since it does do what I wanted it to.",

        title: "Net-Art Prototype",
        intro: "My internet artwork is a website that consists of three sections, they are seperated by a long empty space. This empty space as well as the slow moving particles that are avoiding the user's cursor, and the cold colour of the background are the main elements of the artwork.",

        intro: "My goal for the technical side of this project was to add more features to my site in such a way that it improves the experience of my net art without muddying the site with random, unecesarry features. This proved to be challanging seeing that I have had very basic practice with react (I've only made two ReactJS sites) - this made experimenting with new React features an arduous endeavour.",

        title: "Final Creative Reflection",
        intro: "For this iteration of the website I wanted to make some changes to the style of my site so that it emphasises the emotions that I am trying to evoke in the user so that it aligns with my net art - most of the changes I made to my design was because of my net art. After I have made the changes that I wanted to make I looked at the feedback from the previous version of this site.",

    {
        title: "Net-Art Final",
        intro: "My net-art is a piece that is spread across my entire site. It permeates the entire site because I needed my piece to be interacted with constantly while the user navigates the site. This was necessary because my piece is supposed to evoke certain emotions in the user that linger (like the loneliness many people could not escape during lockdown).",
